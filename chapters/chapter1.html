                    <h2>Jesus: The Unsearchable Christ</h2>
                    
                    <p>This first chapter establishes the foundation of all Christian growth: a clearer vision of who Jesus truly is. Growth in Christ requires that we see Jesus in His fullness, not a reduced or domesticated version.</p>

                        "Have we unintentionally reduced [Jesus] to manageable, predictable proportions? Have we been looking at a junior varsity, decaffeinated, one-dimensional Jesus of our own making, thinking we're looking at the real Jesus?" - Dane Ortlund

                    <h3>Seven Facets of Christ</h3>
                    <p>Ortlund explores seven aspects of Christ that may be under-explored in our generation:</p>
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Ruling</strong> - Jesus exercises supreme authority over the entire universe. "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me" (Matt. 28:18).</li>
                        <li><strong>Saving</strong> - Jesus is not merely helping but fully rescuing. We are not wounded but dead in our trespasses and we need resurrection.</li>
                        <li><strong>Befriending</strong> - Jesus calls us friends. "No longer do I call you servants... but I have called you friends" (John 15:15).</li>
                        <li><strong>Persevering</strong> - Jesus never gives up on His people. "Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end" (John 13:1).</li>
                        <li><strong>Interceding</strong> - Jesus continues to work for us even now in heaven. He "always lives to make intercession" for us (Heb. 7:25).</li>
                        <li><strong>Returning</strong> - Jesus will come back to make all things right.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tender</strong> - Jesus describes himself as "gentle and lowly in heart" (Matt. 11:29). This is the deepest truth about Him.</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <p>Our growth in Christ is stunted when we lose sight of the full, glorious nature of who Jesus is. We will grow only as our vision of Jesus expands and deepens.</p>
                    
                    <div class="key-quote">
                        "The first thing I want to make clear here, early in this book, is that the real Jesus is gentle and lowly in heart. I say the real Jesus because we all unwittingly dilute him."

                    <div class="discussion-questions">
                        <h4>Discussion Questions</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>If you could spend an afternoon with any historical figure who ever lived (besides Jesus), who would you choose and what one question would you most want to ask them? What does your answer reveal about what you value?</li>
                            <li>In what ways might you have "domesticated" Jesus in your own thinking?</li>
                            <li>Which of the seven facets of Christ most surprised you? Which do you need to focus on more?</li>
                            <li>How does seeing Jesus as both ruling in supreme authority AND tender/gentle change how you approach Him?</li>
                            <li>What would it look like to respond to Jesus's tenderness in your daily life?</li>
                            <li>How might your growth change if you focused on "seeing Jesus" more than "trying harder"?</li>
                        </ol>
