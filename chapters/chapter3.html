                    <h2>Union: United with Christ</h2>
                    
                    <p>This chapter explores the central and often neglected truth of union with Christ. The New Testament refers to our being united to Christ over two hundred times - about once per page. It is the controlling center of what it means to be a Christian.</p>
                    
                    <div class="key-quote">
                        "From Christ as from a fountain sanctification flows into the souls of the saints: their sanctification comes not so much from their struggling, and endeavors, and vows, and resolutions, as it comes flowing to them from their union with him." - Jeremiah Burroughs

                    <h3>Four Views of Christian Growth</h3>
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>God then me</strong> - God saves us, then it's up to us to serve him.</li>
                        <li><strong>God not me</strong> - God does everything; we passively wait.</li>
                        <li><strong>God plus me</strong> - We each contribute our part; we're partners.</li>
                        <li><strong>God in me</strong> - The biblical view: we are wholly active and wholly passive. "For it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure" (Phil. 2:13).</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <h3>The Macro and Micro Dimensions</h3>
                    
                    <p>Union with Christ has two key dimensions:</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Macro (Federal) Union</strong>: Christ is our representative head. As He goes, so we go. "As in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive" (1 Cor. 15:22). We have been transferred from Adam's fallen realm to Christ's new creation.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Micro (Intimate) Union</strong>: We are organically joined to Christ, like branches to a vine or members to a body. Our oneness with Christ is so real that Paul can say our sins would implicate Christ himself (1 Cor. 6:15-17).</p>
                    
                    <p>In Christ, we find our true selves. Our union with Christ doesn't destroy our individuality but restores it to what God intended.</p>

                        "You will not change until you get straight who Jesus is, particularly with regard to his surprising tenderness."

                        <ol>
                            <li>What's the most meaningful relationship or connection in your life outside your immediate family? What makes this connection so significant, and how has it shaped who you are?</li>
                            <li>How would you describe your current understanding of what it means to be "in Christ"?</li>
                            <li>Which of the four approaches to Christian growth have you tended to follow?</li>
                            <li>How does understanding your union with Christ change how you view your sins and failures?</li>
                            <li>What would it look like to live today with a stronger awareness that you are "in Christ"?</li>
                            <li>How does union with Christ affect your identity and sense of security?</li>
