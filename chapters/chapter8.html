                    <h2>Breathing: Bible Reading and Prayer</h2>
                    
                    <p>This chapter addresses the practical tools by which we access and experience the transformative truths explored in previous chapters. Bible reading and prayer are the vital rhythm of the Christian life.</p>
                    
                    <div class="key-quote">
                        "Reading the Bible is inhaling. Praying is exhaling."
                    </div>
                    
                    <h3>Our Greatest Earthly Treasure</h3>
                    
                    <p>The Bible is our greatest earthly treasure. It is not an ancillary benefit for a life otherwise well ordered, but the very oxygen that sustains our souls. Jesus prayed, "Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth" (John 17:17).</p>
                    
                    <p>The Bible reconstructs our thinking, dismantling our wrong assumptions and rebuilding truth in their place. And it also oxygenates us, filling us with the life, wisdom, and presence of God himself.</p>
                    
                    <h3>A Book of Good News</h3>
                    
                    <p>Many of us approach the Bible as suffocating rather than oxygenating. We see it as a collection of demands and obligations. But the Bible is fundamentally good news, not a pep talk. It is reporting on what God has done, not merely instructing us on what we must do.</p>
                    
                    <p>We should read the Bible asking not mainly whom to imitate and how to live but what it shows us about a God who loves to save and about sinners who need saving.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Prayer as Exhaling</h3>
                    
                    <p>Prayer is our response to God's word. It is speaking to a real person with whom we have an actual relationship. To pray is to acknowledge that God is not an impersonal force or an abstract ideal, but a Father who loves to hear from his children.</p>
                    
                    <p>We are encouraged to "pray without ceasing" (1 Thess. 5:17), moving through our days in moment-by-moment communion with God, not just in segmented prayer times.</p>
                    
                    <div class="key-quote">
                        "You wouldn't try to go through life holding your breath. So don't go through life without Bible reading and praying. Let your soul breathe."

                            <li>How does viewing Bible reading as "inhaling" and prayer as "exhaling" change your understanding of these practices?</li>
                            <li>What are some common but wrong ways you have approached Bible reading in the past?</li>
                            <li>How might seeing the Bible primarily as "good news" rather than instruction transform your experience of reading it?</li>
                            <li>What makes prayer feel difficult or burdensome at times?</li>
                            <li>What would "praying without ceasing" look like in your daily life?</li>
